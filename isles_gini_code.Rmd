##Setup

```{r data load}
dat1 <- read_csv("Player Season Totals - Natural Stat Trick.csv") %>% clean_names() 
#Credit NST

dat2 <- dplyr::select(dat1, player, team, position, gp, toi, cf_60, ca_60) %>%
  group_by(team) %>%
  mutate(toi_rank = rank(-toi, ties.method = "random"),
         position = ifelse(position %in% c("L", "C", "R"), "F", "D")) %>% ungroup() %>%
  group_by(team, position) %>%
  mutate(toi_position_rank = rank(-toi, ties.method = "random")) %>% ungroup()

ranks <- filter( dat2, gp > 10) %>% arrange(desc(cf_60))

table(dat2$toi_rank) #NST successfully split traded players
filter(dat2, position == "F") %>% dplyr::select(toi_position_rank) %>% table(.)
#For forwards, we start losing some teams at the 16th player (1 team has 13 only).

sixteenth <- filter(dat2, toi_position_rank == 16)
fullest <- anti_join(distinct(dat2, team), sixteenth)
nsh <- filter(dat2, team == "NSH")
#Yup, NSH 

isles <- filter(dat2, team == "NYI")
#Best F cutoff looks like the top 16, which is everyone except Dal Colle, Bernier, and Johnston, who have played 4, 4, and 3 games each. Then we can compare F to every team except NSH For them, just ignore or research solution
#Could also look into comparing everyone with any icetime, but would definitely need to adjust that for different n
#Or could do weighted gini by TOI
#Barzal sees time in both zones, see Bourne, so noshock he allows some. Tavares is equal but wins on sh%
```

```{r isles cf and ca}
ggplot(filter(isles, position == "F"), aes(x = cf_60, y = ca_60)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_text(aes(label=player),hjust=0, vjust=0) + geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1) + 
  labs(x = "Corsi For Per 60", y = "Corsi Against Per 60") + 
  theme_minimal() 
#Need to clean up, add name labels, show for 1 position or at least with tiny TOI cut, add a diagonal 50% line
```


```{r gini forwards}

#F gini CF is pretty high, and ones above it have clear stars or are TOR. That's ok if you're winning, problematic if not. 
#F gini CA is more normal, so maybe systems there
#WSH has 2 nothing guys who did nothing. Would like to cut them
#CF/60 is the rate at which they product, weighting shows how often they are getting that type of production

```{r gini plots}

Should I do the whole thing with points?
